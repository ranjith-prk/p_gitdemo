Private IP is used to connect within the system.

Connecting from Linux to Linux:

   1.Copy Public IP from aws 
   2.Open terminal change "keypair" permissions --> chmod 600 keyname - One time process
   3.Linux to linux we use ssh command: #ssh -i keypairdestination username@publicIP 

Windows to Linux  we use putty :

   1.Download putty
   2.Convert key in .pem to .ppk using putty gen
   3.Open Putty and paste public ip in hostname or public ip option in session section
   4.Click on SSH section --> Auth --> Browse keypair from system in privatekey option
   5.Click on open --> It will connect to terminal
